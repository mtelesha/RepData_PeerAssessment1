## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
# using unzip to decompres the file
# if(!file.exists("./activity.csv")) else if {
#     unzip("activity.zip", exdir = ".")}
# read csv into data frame called df.activities
df_actities <- read.csv(file = "./activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df_actities$date <- as.Date(df_actities$date)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
### make a histogram of the steps per day
df_actities %>%
    filter(steps <= 1) %>%
    ggvis(x = ~date, y = ~steps) %>%
    layer_histograms(width = 1)
    
### mean and median of steps per day
#### Mean of the steps per day
mean_activities <- df_actities %>%
    filter(steps >= 1) %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(mean(steps))

print(mean_activities, type = "html")
#### Median of the steps per day
median_activities <- df.actities %>%
    filter(steps <= 1) %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(median(steps)) %>%
    as_data_frame()

median_activities
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r, echo = TRUE}

```


## Imputing missing values
```{r, echo = TRUE}

```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r, echo = TRUE}

```
